    "Working as a Lead Engineer is quite tiring especially before releases and higher management meetings. Thankfully, I've developed a hobby which let's me unwind and at the same time helps me build a global perspective. As someone who loves travelling, finding ways to save money and travel low-cost is essential. There's little to save while booking flights and I'd rather pay more to traveling comfortably on a 16Hr flight than try to save and wear myself down even before the trip begins! But we can always save a few bucks on accomodation.\n",

    "A hostel is a low-budget accommodation shared among travelers. Staying at hostels is an extremely affordable option for travelers. Not only that, It also gives you a chance to expereince which you would never at a hotel. I've found that experiencing hostel life one of the best ways to travel the world on a budget and hereâ€™s why:\n",

    "Hostel accomodation is a booming industry with the latest rise in tourism worldwide, especially in Asia. Over 20% of the total tourists worldwide are aged between 19-25. And around 80% of them prefer to spend less on accomodation by opting for hostels. This means the demand for hostels is only going to grow further and more people would want to get their legs in the game. \n",
    "- How should a new business person decide where to build for a hostel?\n",

    "- Which neighborhood venues affect a user's rating for *location* of hostel?\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, it is difficult for a travellers, especially first-timers, to select a hostel from among many options. Hostel reviews are subjective and differ from person-to-person and one cannot solely depend on them to make a decision. It is especially important to consider other aspects like price and neighborhood, which can greatly influence one's experience of the city/country.\n",
    "I will try to answer the following questions \n",
    "- How does price vary with location?\n",
    "- Where are the <i>'value of money'</i> hostels located?\n",
    "- How does proximity to transportation affect hostel rating?\n",
    "- Which hostels are most secure and where are they located?\n",
    "- Suggest similar hostel but which cheaper price\n",
